  %b Hi #{@resource.first_name}!

%p Forgot your password? We just received a request to reset it. To verify that you made this request, we're sending this confirmation email.

%p You can reset your password through the link below:

%table{ border: "0", cellpadding: "0", cellspacing: "0", width: "100%" }
  %tr
    %td{ align: "center" }
      = link_to 'Reset password', edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token), class: 'button'

%p Alternatively, you may also copy/paste the following link into your browser:
%b
  %em= edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token)

%p If you didn't request this, please ignore this email. Your password won't change until you access one of the links above and create a new one.

%p Thank you!
